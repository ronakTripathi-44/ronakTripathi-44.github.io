description: As a civil systems engineer I try and use data analysis and systems thinking to develop resilient, agile solutions to the challenges facing our construction industry. I am currently enrolled at the Technische Universität Berlin, in the Masters program Civil Systems Engineering, where we learn to deploy holistic Systems Thinking approach and data analytics to upgrade and digitize construction practices. I currently live in Berlin, where I was employed at the Reib_CFK Projectat Entwerfen und Konstruieren Massivbau and currently I work for the cabon capture mineralization project Seq Kalz at Bauchemie.
