title: Building Occupancy Modeling for Sustainable Smart Buildings, A Comparative Study of Agent Based, Machine Learning, and Stochastic Approaches
description: This paper addresses this challenge by evaluating three modeling approaches that represent different strategies for transforming occupancy data into actionable intelligence. Each approach embodies a different philosophy: ABM seeks to understand the micro-level behaviors that generate macro-level patterns; kNN leverages historical patterns to predict future states; and Markov Chains model the stochastic nature of occupancy transitions. Together, they offer us a chance to develop strategies and a perspective on what we would call the "whole life cycle" of occupancy information—from data collection through modeling to application.
