## Project Overview

In early project phases (HOAI Leistungsphasen 1–3), key design decisions—such as building orientation, massing, and window configuration—are often made with limited quantitative feedback. Detailed simulations are typically introduced later, when the design freedom to respond to performance findings is already constrained.

This project investigates how early-stage solar and daylighting analysis within a BIM environment can support more informed concept development without claiming detailed engineering accuracy.

## Methodology

Scope and Methodology

Using an open-source Revit model, simplified analyses were carried out directly during the conceptual design stage:

Solar analysis to assess relative facade exposure and massing effects

Lighting/daylighting analysis to evaluate daylight distribution and penetration depth

The focus was placed on interpretability and decision support, rather than on final compliance or certification-level results.

## Systems Engineering Perspective on Leistungsphase 1-3

Systems Engineering Perspective

From a systems engineering viewpoint, early performance analysis improves feedback loops between design intent and environmental response. Even simplified simulations help reduce uncertainty, highlight sensitivities, and guide attention to critical design parameters.

Such analyses serve as a qualitative performance check and a valuable preparation step for later, high-fidelity calculations by specialist planners.

Key Takeaway

Early-stage solar and daylighting analysis in BIM enhances conceptual design quality in HOAI LPH 1–3 by providing fast, interpretable feedback. While not a substitute for detailed simulations, it strengthens early decision-making and supports a more integrated planning process.
