title: Evaluating the Reuse of Recycled Asphalt- A Sensitivity Analysis for Circular Economy Integration 
description:  This term project aims to guide decision-makers by developing a risk assessment model that evaluates the reuse of recycled pavement materials under both optimistic and pessimistic degradation scenarios. The model examines key performance indicators such as compressive strength, flexural strength, rutting resistance, fatigue, and cost, with adjustable input variables to reflect different conditions. Through sensitivity analysis, the study assesses the feasibility of reusing degraded materials in new pavements. Ultimately, the project offers a framework to assist decision-makers in conducting risk assessments as we move toward a more sustainable "Era of Reuse." The findings suggest that even in worst-case scenarios, recycled materials retain adequate performance for use in less critical infrastructure, thus contributing to the circular economy.
