title: Perspective view and documentation for high quality rendering and representation in Revit 
description:  Here I tried to use my knowledge of Revit and put together a decent sectional breakdown of a residential complex. Thanks to open-source platforms like revit library, such models can be created and collaberated on with relative ease. Although the Rendering feature embedded in Revit is not always reliable to produce high quality, high DPI images for documentation, it must be noted that they have the option to use Twinmotion withing the Revit interface itself!

- BIM
