title:  Circular Economy Design Study, an Adaptive Reuse of a Shipping Container Café
description:  This project investigates the adaptive reuse of decommissioned shipping containers as a low-impact architectural intervention, framed through circular economy principles and supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) and real-time visualization. The study explores how existing industrial assets can be repurposed with minimal environmental cost, extending their functional lifespan while reducing the need for new material extraction. Shipping containers were selected as a case study due to their inherent structural robustness, modularity, and global availability as post-use assets. Rather than approaching the project as a ground-up architectural design, the focus is placed on asset reuse, retrofit strategies, and digital representation, aligning with circular economy objectives.
