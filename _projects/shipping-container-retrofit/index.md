title:  Circular Economy Design Study, an Adaptive Reuse of a Shipping Container Café
description:  This project investigates the adaptive reuse of decommissioned shipping containers as a low-impact architectural intervention, framed through circular economy principles and supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) and real-time visualization. The study explores how existing industrial assets can be repurposed with minimal environmental cost, extending their functional lifespan while reducing the need for new material extraction. Shipping containers were selected as a case study due to their inherent structural robustness, modularity, and global availability as post-use assets. Rather than approaching the project as a ground-up architectural design, the focus is placed on asset reuse, retrofit strategies, and digital representation, aligning with circular economy objectives.

## Project Overview

This project investigates the adaptive reuse of decommissioned shipping containers as a low-impact architectural intervention, framed through circular economy principles and supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) and real-time visualization. The study explores how existing industrial assets can be repurposed with minimal environmental cost, extending their functional lifespan while reducing the need for new material extraction.

Shipping containers were selected as a case study due to their inherent structural robustness, modularity, and global availability as post-use assets. Rather than approaching the project as a ground-up architectural design, the focus is placed on **asset reuse, retrofit strategies, and digital representation**, aligning with circular economy objectives.

## **Circular Economy Framework**

The conceptual basis of the project draws on **Walter R. Stahel’s foundational work on the circular economy**, particularly his articulation of the **“Era of R” (Reuse, Repair, Remanufacture)** and the **“Era of D” (Decomposition and Recycling)**. Stahel emphasizes that the most environmentally efficient systems are those that maintain existing assets in productive use for as long as possible, minimizing energy consumption, material loss, and waste generation.

In this context, adaptive reuse represents a closed-loop strategy within the Era of R, where a shipping container—originally designed for logistics—is repurposed into a café structure with limited material intervention. The loop is only transitioned into the Era of D when reuse is no longer viable, ensuring that recycling or decomposition occurs with the **lowest possible environmental burden**.

This project positions architectural retrofitting as a practical mechanism for closing material loops, demonstrating how waste goods can be transformed into functional spaces without incurring the embodied carbon costs associated with demolition and new construction.

## **Design and Modelling Approach**

An open-source Revit model of a shipping container café was used as a base reference and adapted for this study. The model was evaluated and refined to understand spatial configuration, material logic, and retrofit feasibility. Modifications focused on clarity of form, spatial organization, and preparing the geometry for downstream visualization rather than aesthetic reinvention.

The use of an existing BIM model reflects real-world circular design practice, where designers increasingly work with inherited assets, legacy data, and pre-existing structures rather than blank-slate conditions.

## **Digital Workflow and Visualization**

The project follows a structured digital pipeline to translate BIM data into high-quality visual output:

- Open-source Revit model adaptation and cleanup  
- Export of geometry to STL format  
- Import into Twinmotion for real-time visualization  
- Material assignment, lighting design, and environmental context  
- Production of final rendered images  

Twinmotion was used to communicate design intent, materiality, and human scale, emphasizing how visualization tools can support sustainable design narratives and stakeholder engagement. The final renders aim to convey the social and environmental potential of adaptive reuse rather than purely formal expression.

## **Key Outcomes**

This project demonstrates how circular economy theory can be operationalized through architectural retrofitting and digital workflows. By prioritizing reuse over replacement, the study highlights the role of designers in extending asset lifecycles and reducing environmental impact through informed, low-intervention strategies.
